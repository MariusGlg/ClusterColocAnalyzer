# ClusterColocAnalyzer
The script loads two picasso DBSCAN files (_dbcluster, contains cluster information) and calculates the euclidean
distance between all cluster centroids. If the distance is below a user defined threshold, it is defined
as colocalization and the DBSCAN cluster information (x, y position, cluster size etc.) are extracted 
from the dataset and saved seperately. The script intends to detect rare colocalization within two-target
SMLM experiments and allows the seperate analysis of these clusters. 
- Loads HDF5 files (Picasso DBSCAN files (dbcluster.hdf5))
- calculate the euclidean distance between cluster centroids
- user defined threshold defines colocalization between clusters
- information from clusters that colocalize are saved seperately (as .hdf5) for further analysis 

Requirements: python 3.7, os, configparser, h5py, numpy, matplotlib, yaml, numba, math, collections, sys
