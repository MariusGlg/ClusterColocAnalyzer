# ClusterColocAnalyzer
Analyzes two picasso DBSCAN files (from a two-target SMLM experiment, _dbclusters.hdf5) for cluster colocalization based on user defined distance threshold. Saves individual, colocalizing single-molecule cluster information (centroid coordinates, size, number of molecules etc.) as a new picasso compatible _dbcluster.hdf5
